                  <p>In 1978, a young journalist was asked to investigate the lost brain of Einstein. Yes! It was lost! It was the first assignment of the aspiring journalist Steven Levy. He went through old newspapers at the local library near Princeton, the place where Einstein spent his last days. Einstein was the most celebrated scientist; it is true even today, but it was true even then. Einstein did not want his tombstone to become a sanctum. He had specifically instructed in his will to be cremated and his ashes to be dispersed at unknown locations.</p> 

                  <p>But the very next day of his death, the newspaper read - "Einstein’s Brain will be preserved for study." This was the first time even Einstein's family heard about it. Outraged, they visited Princeton Hospital to find the pathologist who conducted the autopsy of Einstein. He had taken out the brain without anyone's consent. This pathologist, Dr. Thomas Harvey, convinced the family that it would be a shame for mankind to not understand how the brain of the metaphor of genius works. After heavy convincing and promising that none of Einstein’s brain would become a sanctum, Dr. Harvey explored how he could study the brain better with the limited resources available. Sadly, he could not find anything too out of the ordinary.</p>

                  </div> 

                  <p>Twenty years passed by, and the young journalist found Dr. Harvey and knocked on his door. He was older and demotivated because he had failed to study Einstein's brain. No longer at Princeton, divorced, and carrying a lot of emotional baggage, he felt like a lost soldier. Pressed by the journalist, he finally broke down and showed the brain of Einstein, kept in a few cardboard boxes, well preserved.</p>

                  <p>The story came out and spread like wildfire. People gathered around Dr. Harvey's house, asking him about the brain and even bribing him for it. People waited outside the house in queues. It almost became a gathering... a sanctum! Once again, Dr. Harvey felt like a failure.</p>

                  <p>But this led to a new angle that Dr. Harvey could not see. He had acted as a time capsule for the brain. In those twenty years, technology to study the human brain had advanced. The article helped Dr. Harvey connect with leading scientists.</p>

                  <p>Finally, in 1999, Lancet published an article discussing fascinating discoveries about Einstein's brain, with Dr. Harvey as one of the co-authors. For the first time, Dr. Harvey felt he had contributed to fulfilling his promise of uncovering the extraordinary aspects of Einstein's brain.</p>

                  <p>In the end, spanning decades, Dr. Thomas Harvey found redemption not only in scientific journals but within himself. What began as an act of preservation evolved into a beacon of scientific inquiry, with Einstein's brain serving as a catalyst for advancing our understanding of the human mind. Through the lens of time, Dr. Harvey's legacy transformed from one of controversy to one of contribution, guiding it through the currents of scientific progress. His persistence and resilience turned what seemed like a failed endeavor into a testament to the enduring pursuit of knowledge and our remarkable capacity for discovery.</p>

                  <p>The research continues, as the human brain still fascinates us with profound questions and discoveries, with Einstein’s story being one we revisit for inspiration.</p>
